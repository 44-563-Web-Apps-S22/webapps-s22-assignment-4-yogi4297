        I agree, and I enjoy them as you do. There is surely
        nothing more agreeable than the applause you speak of; but that
        incense does not provide a living. Pure praises do not provide a
        comfortable existence; it is necessary to add something solid, and
        the best way to praise is to praise with cash-in-hand.  He's a man,
        it's true, whose insight is very slight, who talks nonsense about
        everything and applauds only for the wrong reasons but his money
        makes up for his judgments. He has discernment in his purse. His
        praises are in cash, and this ignorant bourgeois is worth more to
        us, as you see, than the educated nobleman who introduced us here.

        There is some truth in what you say; but I find
        that you lean a little too heavily on money; and material interest
        is something so base that a man of good taste should never show an
        attachment to it.

        You are ready enough to receive the money our man
        gives you.
