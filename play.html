        <h3>The Middle Class Gentleman</h4>

        <h4>ACT ONE - SCENE I (Music Master, Dancing Master, Musicians, and Dancers)</h4>
        <pre>
            MUSIC MASTER: (To Musicians) Come, come into this room, sit there
            and wait until he comes.

            DANCING MASTER: (To dancers) And you too, on this side.

            MUSIC MASTER: (To Pupil) Is it done?

            PUPIL: Yes.

            MUSIC MASTER: Let's see... This is good.

            DANCING MASTER: Is it something new?

            MUSIC MASTER: Yes, it's a melody for a serenade that I set him to
            composing here, while waiting for our man to awake.

            DANCING MASTER: May I see it?

            MUSIC MASTER: You'll hear it, with the dialogue, when he comes.  He
            won't be long.

            DANCING MASTER: Our work, yours and mine, is not trivial at
            present.

            MUSIC MASTER: This is true. We've found here such a man as we both
            need. This is a nice source of income for us--this Monsieur
            Jourdain, with the visions of nobility and gallantry that he has
            gotten into his head. You and I should hope that everyone resembled
            him.

            DANCING MASTER: Not entirely; I could wish that he understood
            better the things that we give him.

            MUSIC MASTER: It's true that he understands them poorly, but he
            pays well, and that's what our art needs now more than anything
            else.

            DANCING MASTER: As for me, I admit, I feed a little on glory.
            Applause touches me; and I hold that, in all the fine arts, it is
            painful to produce for dolts, to endure the barbarous opinions of a
            fool about my choreography. It is a pleasure, don't tell me
            otherwise, to work for people who can appreciate the fine points of
            an art, who know how to give a sweet reception to the beauties of a
            work and, by pleasurable approbations, gratify us for our labor.
            Yes, the most agreeable recompense we can receive for the things we
            do is to see them recognized and flattered by an applause that
            honors us. There is nothing, in my opinion, that pays us better for
            all our fatigue; and it is an exquisite delight to receive the
            praises of the well-informed.
